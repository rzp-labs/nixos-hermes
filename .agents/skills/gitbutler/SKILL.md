# GitButler CLI Skill

Use GitButler CLI (`but`) as the default version-control interface.

## Non-Negotiable Rules

1. Use `but` for all write operations. Never run `git add`, `git commit`, `git push`, `git checkout`, `git merge`, `git rebase`, `git stash`, or `git cherry-pick`. If the user says a `git` write command, translate it to `but` and run that.
2. Always add `--status-after` to mutation commands.
3. Use CLI IDs from `but status -fv` / `but diff` / `but show`; never hardcode IDs.
4. Start with `but status -fv` before mutations so IDs and stack state are current.
5. Create a branch for new work with `but branch new <name>` when needed.
6. For history optimization, **do not rebuild state with `git diff` + `git apply`**. Use GitButler primitives (`but rub`, `but squash`, `but move`, `but reword`, `but uncommit`) to reshape commits and branches. If you think native git is required, stop and explain the exact GitButler limitation before doing it.
7. There is no production-pressure excuse for bypassing GitButler. If the right command is unfamiliar, explore the local skill/reference or `but --help` after checking the reference, then use the GitButler-native operation.

## Core Flow

**Every write task** should follow this sequence.

```bash
# 1. Inspect state and gather IDs
but status -fv

# 2. If new branch needed:
but branch new <name>

# 3. Edit files (Edit/Write tools)

# 4. Refresh IDs if needed
but status -fv

# 5. Perform mutation with IDs from status/diff/show
but <mutation> ... --status-after
```

## Command Patterns

- Commit: `but commit <branch> -m "<msg>" --changes <id>,<id> --status-after`
- Commit + create branch: `but commit <branch> -c -m "<msg>" --changes <id> --status-after`
- Amend: `but amend <file-id> <commit-id> --status-after`
- Reorder commits: `but move <source-commit-id> <target-commit-id> --status-after` (**commit IDs**, not branch names)
- Stack branches: `but move <branch-name-or-id> <target-branch-name-or-id> --status-after` (**branch names or branch CLI IDs**)
- Tear off a branch: `but move <branch-name-or-id> zz --status-after` (`zz` = unassigned; branch name or branch CLI ID)
- Equivalent branch subcommand syntax remains available: `but branch move <branch-name> <target-branch-name>` and `but branch move --unstack <branch-name>`
- Push: `but push` or `but push <branch-id>`
- Pull: `but pull --check` then `but pull --status-after`

## Task Recipes

### Commit files

1. `but status -fv`
2. Find the CLI ID for each file you want to commit.
3. `but commit <branch> -m "<msg>" --changes <id1>,<id2> --status-after`
   Use `-c` to create the branch if it doesn't exist. Omit IDs you don't want committed.
4. **Check the `--status-after` output** for remaining uncommitted changes. If the file still appears as unassigned or assigned to another branch after commit, it may be dependency-locked. See "Stacked dependency / commit-lock recovery" below.

### Amend into existing commit

1. `but status -fv` (or `but show <branch-id>`)
2. Locate file ID and target commit ID.
3. `but amend <file-id> <commit-id> --status-after`

### Optimize a messy branch before PR

Use GitButler as the commit-composition tool. Do **not** export a patch and apply it to a new branch unless GitButler cannot represent the operation and you have said why.

1. Inspect the stack with `but status -fv` and `but show <branch-id>` / `but branch show <branch-name> -f`.
2. Decide the target atomic commits: which files/hunks belong together and in what order.
3. Use `but rub` for moving material:
   - `but rub <file-id> <commit-id> --status-after` — amend a file/hunk into the right commit.
   - `but rub <file-in-commit-id> <commit-id> --status-after` — move a committed file from one commit to another.
   - `but rub <commit-id> <commit-id> --status-after` — squash one commit into another when they are the same logical change.
   - `but rub <commit-id> zz --status-after` — uncommit a bad commit to unassigned changes, then recommit selected files/hunks.
4. Use `but squash <commits> -m "message" --status-after` for straightforward collapse.
5. Use `but move <commit-id> <target-commit-id> --status-after` for ordering, and `but reword <commit-id> -m "message"` for message cleanup.
6. Re-run `but status -fv` after each mutation because CLI IDs can change.
7. Validate, then `but push <branch>`.

If a clean replacement branch is still warranted, prefer GitButler-native reconstruction: create the branch with `but branch new`, then use file tools to edit the working tree and `but commit --changes ...`. Avoid `git apply`; patch replay hides whether you understood the GitButler object model.

### Reorder commits

`but move` supports both commit reordering and branch stack operations. Use commit IDs when reordering commits.

1. `but status -fv`
2. `but move <commit-a> <commit-b> --status-after` — uses commit IDs like `c3`, `c5`
3. Refresh IDs from the returned status, then run the inverse: `but move <commit-b> <commit-a> --status-after`

### Stack existing branches

To make one existing branch depend on (stack on top of) another, use top-level `move`:

```bash
but move feature/frontend feature/backend
```

This moves the frontend branch on top of the backend branch in one step.

Equivalent subcommand syntax:

```bash
but branch move feature/frontend feature/backend
```

**DO NOT** use `uncommit` + `branch delete` + `branch new -a` to stack existing branches. That approach fails because git branch names persist even after `but branch delete`. Always use `but move <branch> <target-branch>` (or the equivalent `but branch move ...`).

**To unstack** (make a stacked branch independent again):

```bash
but move feature/logging zz
```

Equivalent subcommand syntax:

```bash
but branch move --unstack feature/logging
```

**Note:** branch stack/tear-off operations use branch **names** (like `feature/frontend`) or branch CLI IDs, while commit reordering uses commit **IDs** (like `c3`). Do NOT use `but undo` to unstack — it may revert more than intended and lose commits.

### Proven-bad applied branch: unapply first, then diagnose

If runtime evidence proves that an applied GitButler branch is the regression — for example `nixos-rebuild --rollback` or unapplying a stack immediately restores the broken service — stop patching forward in the same dirty workspace.

Preferred recovery:

1. Preserve the evidence in the response or notes: which rollback/unapply action restored behavior, and what symptom disappeared.
2. Unapply the suspect branch/stack from the workspace:

   ```bash
   but unapply <branch-or-stack> --status-after
   ```

3. If unapply leaves tiny unassigned residue caused by your attempted repair, inspect it with `but diff`; discard only residue that is clearly from the failed repair:

   ```bash
   but discard <change-id> --status-after
   ```

4. Only after the workspace is back to known-good should you decide whether to create a fresh narrower branch, revert a specific commit, or ask for direction.

Do **not** keep surgically editing config after the user has provided decisive rollback evidence that the whole branch is bad. That is patch-forward tunnel vision and risks extending the outage.

### Stacked dependency / commit-lock recovery

A **dependency lock** occurs when a file was originally committed on branch A, but you're trying to commit changes to it on branch B. Symptoms:
- `but commit` succeeds but the file still appears in `unassignedChanges` in the `--status-after` output
- The file shows as "unassigned" instead of being staged to any branch

**Recovery:** Stack your branch on the dependency branch, then commit:

1. `but status -fv` — identify which branch originally owns the file (check commit history).
2. `but move <your-branch-name> <dependency-branch-name>` — stack your branch on the dependency. Uses full branch **names**, not CLI IDs.
3. `but status -fv` — the file should now be assignable. Commit it.
4. `but commit <branch> -m "<msg>" --changes <id> --status-after`

**If `but move <branch> <target-branch>` fails:** Do NOT try `uncommit`, `squash`, or `undo` to work around it — these will leave the workspace in a worse state. Instead, re-run `but status -fv` to confirm both branches still exist and are applied, then retry with exact branch names from the status output.

### Resolve conflicts after reorder/move

**NEVER use `git add`, `git commit`, `git checkout --theirs`, `git checkout --ours`, or any git write commands during resolution.** Only use `but resolve` commands and edit files directly with the Edit tool.

If `but move` causes conflicts (conflicted commits in status):

1. `but status -fv` — find commits marked as conflicted.
2. `but resolve <commit-id>` — enter resolution mode. This puts conflict markers in the files.
3. **Read the conflicted files** to see the `<<<<<<<` / `=======` / `>>>>>>>` markers.
4. **Edit the files** to resolve conflicts by choosing the correct content and removing markers.
5. `but resolve finish` — finalize. Do NOT run this without editing the files first.
6. Repeat for any remaining conflicted commits.

**Common mistakes:** Do NOT use `but amend` on conflicted commits (it won't work). Do NOT skip step 4 — you must actually edit the files to remove conflict markers before finishing.

## Git-to-But Map

| git | but |
|---|---|
| `git status` | `but status -fv` |
| `git add` + `git commit` | `but commit ... --changes ...` |
| `git checkout -b` | `but branch new <name>` |
| `git push` | `but push` |
| `git rebase -i` | `but move`, `but squash`, `but reword` |
| `git rebase --onto` | `but branch move <branch> <new-base>` |
| `git cherry-pick` | `but pick` |

## Notes

- Prefer explicit IDs over file paths for mutations.
- `--changes` accepts comma-separated values (`--changes a1,b2`) or repeated flags (`--changes a1 --changes b2`), not space-separated.
- Read-only git inspection (`git log`, `git blame`, `git show --stat`) is allowed.
- After a successful `--status-after`, don't run a redundant `but status -fv` unless you need new IDs.
- Use `but show <branch-id>` to see commit details for a branch, including per-commit file changes and line counts.
- **Per-commit file counts**: `but status` does NOT include per-commit file counts. Use `but show <branch-id>` or `git show --stat <commit-hash>` to get them.
- Avoid `--help` probes; use this skill and `references/reference.md` first. Only use `--help` after a failed attempt.
- Run `but skill check` only when command behavior diverges from this skill, not as routine preflight.
- Edge case: `but branch delete <name>` can fail to remove an unapplied/stale branch with `not found in any stack`, and after applying it can refuse with `would leave an anonymous segment`. First try GitButler-native cleanup (`but apply`, `but unapply`, `but uncommit --discard` as appropriate). If GitButler still cannot delete the branch and the intent is only stale branch cleanup, state the limitation, then use the narrow native fallback: delete the local branch/ref and any stale remote-tracking ref (`git branch -D <name>`, `git branch -dr origin/<name>`). Do not use this fallback for history reshaping.
